## Automated prediction of treatment effectiveness in ovarian cancer using histopathological images

## Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the second most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in women around the world. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for over 95% of ovarian malignancies. Most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed in advanced stage, which accounts for the high mortality rate. EOC is classified into at least five distinct histopathological subtypes, including high-grade serous, low-grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid, and mucinous ovarian cancer. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common histologic subtype, accounting for more than 70% of EOCs. Despite the progress made during the last two decades in the surgery and chemotherapy of ovarian cancer, more than 70 % of advanced patients are with recurrent cancer and decease. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which blocks VEGF signaling in cancer, inhibits angiogenesis and causes tumor shrinkage, and has been recently approved by FDA as a monotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer in combination with chemotherapy. Considering the cost, potential toxicity, and finding that only a portion of patients will benefit from these drugs, the identification of new predictive method for the treatment of EOC remains an urgent unmet medical need. Recent studies have shown that the challenge of applying digital whole slide image (WSI) to predict post-treatment response may be solved using deep learning (DL) technologies. Over the past few years, interest in the use of DL based approaches for drug discovery and development has increased. In this challenge, two datasets are constructed, including a whole section slide dataset and an independent TMA slide dataset. To assess the generalizability of the model, the whole section slide dataset will be used for training and the second independent TMA slide dataset will used for testing the DL based approaches. This challenge aims to build an automatic precision oncology system for patient selection and guiding ovarian cancer treatment.

## Datasets
### Training Cohorts
A large whole section whole slide image (WSI) dataset, contains 288 De-identified hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole section slides with clinical information of HGSOC patients collected from the tissue bank of the Tri-Service General Hospital and the National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan. The large training dataset has been accepted to be stored on The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) platform, and the dataset presented here is available at [the training data link](https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.985g-ey35) [1].

### Testing Cohorts
180 tissue cores collected of HGSOC patients are collected from the tissue bank of the Tri-Service General Hospital and the National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan. In order to test the model generalizability on unseen data, an independent and separate testing data set is provided for evaluation of models on not only sensitivity and specificity, but also on generalizability for practical usages. The data link are available at the [TMA Testing Set](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WyHTxMo1qQ5FKF-CJVI_-_8j7StYklpJ).

## Challenge Publication and Prizes
Top-ranked teams will be invited for SCI journal publications and awarded the prizes below. 

A joint challenge paper will be prepared and submitted to journals such as Medical Image Analysis or IEEE trans on Medical Imaging, and two members from the top 10 participating teams from the leaderboards will be invited to contribute to the joint challenge paper as co-authors. 

In addition, three special Issues of the SCI-indexed journals with associated prizes (22,000 CHF in total) have been arranged for the challenge as follows. Top teams will be invited for paper submission to the arranged special issues.

The participating teams may publish their own results separately after the challenge paper is published, **but they should cite the assigned papers listed bellows**.
